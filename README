This middleware allows Campaign Manager reports to be ingested into BigQuery
datasets. This project can be deployed on AppEngine, and handles its own
authentication and cleanup. Jobs are triggered by issuing POST calls, which
allows for use with Cloud Scheduler.

***This is not an officially supported Google product***

## Usage

* Setup a GCP project and deploy it on to AppEngine.
* Grant IAM admin rights to the default service account.
* Create a new service account with BigQuery admin rights.
* Create a DCM profile using this service account's email address.
* Create both the required DCM report and BigQuery dataset.
* POST to `https://[SERVICE_ID]-dot-[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com/[REPORT_ID]/[DATASET_NAME]` with:
    ```
    {
      "profileId": [DCM_PROFILE_ID],
      "emailId": "[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ADDRESS]"
    }
    ```
